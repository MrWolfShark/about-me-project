# LAB - 04

## About Me Web Page

I built an about me webpage. The page will query the user for their name. Then once the user has read the page, they can start a quiz that gives them 5 questions. The quiz is graded and then let's them know how they did.

### Reflections and Comments

This assignment was very fun for me. I have experience in Python programming, but have never really delved into front-end web design. CSS can be challenging since there are so many ways to manipulate text and items. Overall pleased with what I created and hope to make it better in the next lab.
This assignment took me 3-4 hours to complete. Mostly this time was spent on the CSS design and layout. Picking color palets took longer than expected and getting the formatting to look how I wanted was time consuming.
